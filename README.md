# Forecasting air pollution in London following ULEZ expansion (using LSTM)

The Ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) is a tax on high polluting vehicles first introduced in April 2019 on inner London boroughs. If you owned a non-compliant vehicle and entered the ULEZ zone, you would have to pay a charge. In 29 August 2023, this tax zone was expanded to cover all Greater London boroughs. This forecasting project seeks to understand how well LSTM can perform against standard ARIMA models, especially when responding to sudden changes in the time series
